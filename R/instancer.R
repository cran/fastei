#' Simulate an Election
#'
#' @description
#' This function simulates an election by creating matrices representing candidate votes `(X)` and voters' demographic group `(W)` across a specified number of ballot-boxes. It either (i) receives as input or (ii) generates a probability matrix `(prob)`, indicating how likely each demographic group is to vote for each candidate.
#'
#' By default, the number of voters per ballot box `(ballot_voters)` is set to a vector of 100 with
#' length `num_ballots`. You can optionally override this by providing a custom vector.
#'
#' Optional parameters are available to control the distribution of votes:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \strong{`group_proportions`}: A vector of length `num_groups` specifying
#'         the overall proportion of each demographic group. Entries must sum to one and be non-negative.
#'   \item \strong{`prob`}: A user-supplied probability matrix of dimension
#'         (`num_groups` \eqn{\times} `num_candidates`). If provided, this matrix is used directly. Otherwise, voting probabilities for each group are drawn from a Dirichlet distribution.
#' }
#'
#' @param num_ballots
#'   Number of ballot boxes (`b`).
#'
#' @param num_candidates
#'   Number of candidates (`c`).
#'
#' @param num_groups
#'   Number of demographic groups (`g`).
#'
#' @param ballot_voters
#'   A vector of length `num_ballots` representing the number of voters per ballot
#'   box. Defaults to `rep(100, num_ballots)`.
#'
#' @param lambda
#' A numeric value between 0 and 1 that represents the fraction of voters that are randomly assigned to ballot-boxes. The remaining voters are assigned sequentially according to their demographic group.
#'   - `lambda = 0`: The assignment of voters to ballot-boxes is fully sequential in terms of their demographic group. This leads to a **high heterogeneity** of the voters' groups across ballot-boxes.
#'   - `lambda = 1`: The assignment of voters to ballot-boxes is fully random. This leads to a **low heterogeneity** of the voters' group across ballot-boxes.
#'
#'  Default value is set to `0.5`. See **Shuffling Mechanish** for more details.
#'
#' @param seed
#'   If provided, overrides the current global seed. Defaults to `NULL`.
#'
#' @param group_proportions
#'   Optional. A vector of length `num_groups` that indicates the fraction of voters that belong to each group. Default is that all groups are of the same size.
#'
#' @param prob
#'   Optional. A user-supplied probability matrix of dimension `(g x c)`.
#'   If provided, this matrix is used as the underlying voting probability distribution. If not supplied, each row is sampled from a Dirichlet distribution with each parameter set to one.
#'
#' @section Shuffling Mechanism:
#' Without loss of generality, consider an order relation of groups and ballot-boxes. The shuffling step is controlled by the `lambda` parameter and operates as follows:
#'
#' 1. **Initial Assignment**: Voters are assigned to each ballot-box sequentially according to their demographic
#' group. More specifically, the first ballot-boxes receive voters from the first group. Then, the next ballot-boxes receive voters from the second group. This continues until all voters have been assigned. Note that most ballot-boxes will contain voters from a single group (as long as the number of ballot-boxes exceeds the number of groups).
#'
#' 2. **Shuffling**: A fraction `lambda` of voters who have already been assigned is selected at random. Then, the ballot-box assignment of this sample is shuffled. Hence, different `lambda` values are interpreted as follows:
#'
#' 	- `lambda = 0` means no one is shuffled (the initial assignment remains).
#' 	- `lambda = 1` means all individuals are shuffled.
#' 	- Intermediate values like `lambda = 0.5` shuffle half the voters.
#'
#' Using a high level of `lambda` (greater than 0.7) is not recommended, as this could make identification of the voting probabilities difficult. This is because higher values of lambda induce similar ballot-boxes in terms of voters' group.

#' @return An eim object with three attributes:

#'   \item{\code{X}}{A \code{(b x c)} matrix with candidates' votes for each ballot box.}
#'   \item{\code{W}}{A \code{(b x g)} matrix with voters' groups for each ballot-box.}
#'   \item{\code{real_prob}}{A \code{(g x c)} matrix with the probability that a voter from each group votes for each candidate. If prob is provided, it would equal such probability.}
